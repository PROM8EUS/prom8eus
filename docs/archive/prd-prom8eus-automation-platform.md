# Product Requirements Document: PROM8EUS Automation Platform

## 1. Introduction/Overview

PROM8EUS is an intelligent automation platform that analyzes job descriptions and tasks to identify automation opportunities. The platform breaks down high-level tasks into subtasks, calculates potential time and cost savings, and provides matching workflow templates and AI agents. The goal is to help organizations and individuals understand automation potential and implement solutions quickly.

**Problem Statement:** Organizations struggle to identify which tasks can be automated and lack clear ROI calculations to justify automation investments. Manual task analysis is time-consuming and requires technical expertise.

**Solution:** An AI-powered platform that automatically analyzes job postings and tasks, provides detailed ROI calculations, and offers ready-to-deploy automation solutions.

## 2. Goals

1. **Automation Discovery:** Enable users to identify automation opportunities in job descriptions within 5 minutes
2. **ROI Clarity:** Provide clear cost-benefit analysis with customizable parameters (hourly rates, time periods)
3. **Solution Matching:** Offer relevant workflow templates and AI agents based on task analysis
4. **Quick Implementation:** Enable one-click deployment of automation solutions
5. **Accessibility:** Serve both technical and non-technical users with intuitive interface

## 3. User Stories

### Primary User Stories:
1. **Company Owner:** "As a company owner, I want to see automation potential in minutes based on a job description so that I can understand whether to hire a person or implement automation instead."
2. **Working Professional:** "As a working person, I want to see what tasks I do that can be automated so that I can be more efficient and save time."
3. **Automation Evaluator:** "As a person looking at automation potential, I want to see potential savings in time or money so that I can make informed decisions about automation investments."

### Secondary User Stories:
4. **HR Manager:** "As an HR manager, I want to analyze job postings for automation opportunities so that I can optimize hiring decisions and reduce manual workload."
5. **Business Analyst:** "As a business analyst, I want detailed task breakdowns and ROI calculations so that I can present automation proposals to stakeholders."
6. **Operations Manager:** "As an operations manager, I want to test automation solutions in a sandbox environment so that I can validate their effectiveness before deployment."
