# Task List: PROM8EUS Automation Platform Implementation

## Overview
This task list implements the PROM8EUS automation platform based on the PRD requirements, focusing on job analysis, ROI calculations, and an enhanced solutions marketplace with both n8n workflows and AI agents.

## Relevant Files

- `src/components/TaskPanel.tsx` - Main task panel component with solutions tab
- `src/components/TaskSpecificWorkflows.tsx` - Current workflow solutions component
- `src/components/SolutionsTab.tsx` - New enhanced solutions interface
- `src/components/SolutionCard.tsx` - Unified solution display component
- `src/components/SolutionFilters.tsx` - Advanced filtering sidebar
- `src/components/SolutionDetailModal.tsx` - Solution information modal
- `src/components/ui/SolutionIcon.tsx` - Different icons for workflows vs agents
- `src/lib/n8nApi.ts` - n8n workflow API client (needs optimization)
- `src/lib/solutions/aiAgentsCatalog.ts` - AI agents data structure
- `src/lib/solutions/solutionMatcher.ts` - Subtask-to-solution matching logic
- `src/lib/solutions/solutionFilters.ts` - Filtering and search utilities
- `src/types/solutions.ts` - Solution-related TypeScript interfaces
- `src/components/BusinessCase.tsx` - ROI calculation component
- `src/components/TaskList.tsx` - Task list display component
- `src/components/ScoreCircle.tsx` - Progress circle component

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
