# PRD: Codebase Stabilization and Cleanup

**Status**: Draft  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Priority**: High  
**Owner**: Development Team

## 📋 Executive Summary

This PRD addresses the critical need to stabilize and clean up the Prom8eus codebase to make further development easier and more maintainable. While significant cleanup has been completed (documented in `overengineering-remediation-migration-guide.md`), substantial technical debt remains, including:

- **Incomplete migration**: Simplified components exist but aren't used in production
- **Duplicate implementations**: Multiple versions of workflow generators/indexers coexist
- **Weak type safety**: TypeScript strict mode is disabled
- **Code quality issues**: 27 TODO/FIXME/DEPRECATED markers, unused vars warnings disabled
- **Inconsistent architecture**: Mix of old and new patterns throughout codebase

## 🎯 Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Complete the simplified component migration** - Switch production code to use simplified components
2. **Remove duplicate implementations** - Consolidate workflow generator/indexer variants
3. **Enable TypeScript strict mode** - Improve type safety and catch bugs early
4. **Fix all TODO/FIXME items** - Address technical debt markers
5. **Improve code quality** - Enable linting rules, fix warnings, establish consistent patterns

### Secondary Goals
1. **Update documentation** - Ensure all docs reflect actual codebase state
2. **Improve test coverage** - Add missing tests for critical paths
3. **Optimize build configuration** - Remove unused dependencies, optimize bundles
4. **Establish coding standards** - Create and enforce consistent patterns

## 🔍 Problem Statement

### Current Issues

#### 1. **Incomplete Simplified Component Migration** (Critical)
- **TaskPanelSimplified** exists but only used in tests
- **TaskPanel** (814 lines, overengineered) still used in production (`TaskList.tsx`)
- Documentation claims migration is complete, but it's not
- Risk: Confusion about which components to use for new development

#### 2. **Duplicate Workflow Implementations** (High Priority)
Per `workflow-generator-audit.md`:
- **workflowGenerator.ts** (1,277 lines) - actively used, over-engineered
- **workflowGeneratorUnified.ts** (473 lines) - only imported by workflowGenerator.ts
- **workflowGeneratorSimplified.ts** (238 lines) - has tests but minimal usage
- **workflowIndexerUnified.ts** (608 lines) - actively used
- **workflowIndexerSimplified.ts** (exists) - unclear if production-ready

**Impact**: 
- ~2,000+ lines of duplicate code
- Confusion about which to use
- Difficult to maintain
- Performance overhead

#### 3. **Weak TypeScript Configuration** (High Priority)
Current `tsconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "noImplicitAny": false,
  "noUnusedParameters": false,
  "noUnusedLocals": false,
  "strictNullChecks": false
}
```

**Impact**:
- Type safety is severely compromised
- Bugs slip through that TypeScript should catch
- Code quality degrades over time
- Onboarding is harder (unclear types)

#### 4. **Linting Configuration Issues** (Medium Priority)
Current `eslint.config.js`:
```javascript
"@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "off"
```

**Impact**:
- Unused variables accumulate
- Dead code remains in codebase
- Bundle size increases unnecessarily

#### 5. **Technical Debt Markers** (Medium Priority)
- **27 TODO/FIXME/DEPRECATED comments** across 13 files:
  - `src/lib/services/taskDataService.ts` - 6 markers
  - `src/components/ui/StatusBadge.tsx` - 3 markers
  - `src/components/tabs/LLMTab.tsx` - 3 markers
  - `src/components/tabs/AgentTab.tsx` - 3 markers
  - And 9 more files...

**Impact**:
- Unclear if these are still relevant
- Technical debt accumulates
- Code quality perception suffers

#### 6. **Deprecated File Still Referenced** (Medium Priority)
- `src/lib/interfaces/workflowIndexer.ts` exists but main `workflowIndexer.ts` was supposedly removed
- Unclear dependency graph
- Risk of breaking changes
