# Task List: Improved Task Detail View Implementation

## Overview
Improve the current task detail view to provide a more streamlined, informative, and actionable user experience. The new design consolidates business case, subtasks, and solution recommendations into a single, cohesive view with better visual hierarchy and embedded workflow blueprints.

## Relevant Files

### Created Components (7 files)
- `src/components/EffortSection.tsx` - Enhanced effort/ROI section with bar chart and inline hourly rate editing (219 lines)
- `src/components/TopSubtasksSection.tsx` - Displays top 3 subtasks with expand/collapse (185 lines)
- `src/components/SubtaskCard.tsx` - Individual subtask card with workflow visualization and recommendations (210 lines)
- `src/components/BlueprintCard.tsx` - Embedded blueprint card with n8n JSON download (310 lines)
- `src/components/InsightsTrendsSection.tsx` - Displays automation trends with icons and percentages (155 lines)
- `src/components/ImplementationRequestCTA.tsx` - CTA button with implementation request modal (152 lines)

### Created Utilities (2 files)
- `src/lib/trendAnalysis.ts` - Analyzes technology/category/subtask trends from workflows (430 lines)
- `src/lib/workflowMatcher.ts` - Matches workflows to subtasks with scoring algorithm (380 lines)

### Modified Components (1 file)
- `src/components/TaskPanel.tsx` - Updated to use new single-view layout (removed tabs, integrated all new components)

### Unchanged Components (kept as-is)
- `src/components/TaskList.tsx` - Existing task header (already has title, category, ScoreCircle, trend badge)
- `src/components/BusinessCase.tsx` - Kept separate, EffortSection uses own bar chart implementation
- `src/components/ImplementationRequestForm.tsx` - Existing form reused by ImplementationRequestCTA

### Notes
- The new design eliminates tabs and provides a single scrollable view
- Workflow blueprints are embedded within subtask cards rather than in a separate tab
- Top 3 subtasks are shown by default with expand functionality for additional subtasks
- Trend badges indicate technology/approach momentum
