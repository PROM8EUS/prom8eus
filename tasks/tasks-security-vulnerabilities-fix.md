### Notes

- All hardcoded secrets must be moved to environment variables
- Environment variables should be prefixed with `VITE_` for client-side access
- Server-side environment variables should not be prefixed with `VITE_`
- All sensitive data should be validated and sanitized before use
- Security headers should be implemented at both application and deployment level
- Dependencies should be regularly audited and updated
