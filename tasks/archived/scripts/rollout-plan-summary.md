## Rollout Phases Overview

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (1-2 days)**
- Deploy feature toggle system
- Configure monitoring and alerting
- Validate core functionality
- Test rollback mechanisms

### **Phase 2: Core Feature Migration (3-5 days)**
- Enable read and search operations
- Enable write operations
- Enable frontend features
- Implement dark launch (10% → 50% → 100%)

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (5-7 days)**
- Enable AI generation features
- Enable analytics and monitoring
- Implement advanced dark launch (5% → 25% → 100%)
- Validate performance and costs

### **Phase 4: Experimental Features (7-10 days)**
- Enable experimental generator
- Enable experimental features
- Implement minimal dark launch (1% → 5% → 25%)
- Collect user feedback

### **Phase 5: Legacy Deprecation (10-14 days)**
- Enable migration tools
- Deprecate legacy systems
- Clean up deprecated code
- Finalize documentation

## Risk Management Strategy

### **Risk Assessment Matrix**
- **Feature Toggle Failure**: Low probability, High impact → Comprehensive testing, rollback plan
- **Performance Degradation**: Medium probability, Medium impact → Performance monitoring, gradual rollout
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Low probability, High impact → Data validation, backup systems
- **User Experience Issues**: Medium probability, Medium impact → User testing, feedback collection
- **System Downtime**: Low probability, High impact → Redundancy, failover systems

### **Contingency Plans**
- **Immediate Rollback**: Disable all toggles, revert to defaults
- **Partial Rollback**: Disable specific features, maintain core functionality
- **Performance Issues**: Reduce user percentage, investigate bottlenecks
- **User Experience Problems**: Disable features, notify users, implement fixes

## Monitoring and Alerting

### **Key Metrics**
- **Performance**: Response time, throughput, error rate, resource usage
- **Feature Toggles**: Usage, changes, performance impact, user impact
- **Business**: User engagement, feature adoption, error reports, support tickets

### **Alerting Thresholds**
- **Critical**: Error rate > 5%, Response time > 2s, Feature toggle failure
- **Warning**: Error rate > 2%, Response time > 1s, High resource usage

### **Monitoring Tools**
- Application monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, user analytics, error tracking

## Success Criteria

### **Technical Success**
- Zero downtime during rollout
- Performance maintained within acceptable limits
- Error rate below 1%
- Feature toggles functioning correctly

### **Business Success**
- No negative impact on user experience
- New features adopted by users
- No increase in support requests
- Improved development efficiency

### **Operational Success**
- Comprehensive monitoring in place
- Effective alerting for issues
